# compilerDemo
Super simple compiler demo/presentation. It compiles a langauge that consists of '+' and integers separated by a single space into Lisp. The pluses must have an integer on either side, and all of them must be separated by only a single space. The purpose of this repo is to demonstrate the basic steps of compilation. It's so simple because it's the content for a 15 minute presentation.
